### Building Github Pages

I have built my site by Github Pages, recommond [document ](https://pages.github.com/) . If you only want to write blogs, the 300M space of Github Pages is enough to use. Because now the mainstream blog framework are static page, does not involve the interaction with the database, so do not need too much space.

### Learning Hexo

Building hexo environment needs node, npm, and the specific installation steps has been given by hexo [official website](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-blog-with-hexo-on-ubuntu-14-04) . I recommend [learning materials](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-blog-with-hexo-on-ubuntu-14-04) , if after deploying on server, there are not styles, you can deploy on the site again after executing ```hexo clean``` command. I used [jacman theme](https://github.com/wuchong/jacman) , due to the jacman's author has written a detail tutorial, you can complete the theme setting by fowllowing it step by step. 

### Writting blogs by using markdown

I did not know markdown before building blog, so I download a mainstream markdown tool called [reMarkable](https://getremarkable.com/) . After learning basic grammer, I have sorted out common grammer in markdown. I hope it can help you. ![](http://p1.bqimg.com/567571/10524bb9033523f6.png) 

> If some of the result is not what you want, you can add a space and try it again. eg: ```### mengyunzhi```ï¼ˆthere is a space between the last "#"and"m"). 

### Uploading pictures

Because you often need some pictures to explain what you want to express, the feature of uploading pictures is necessary, I used  [Image Uploader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%E6%9E%81%E7%AE%80%E5%9B%BE%E5%BA%8A/heebflcbemenefckkgfnnklbhdbdkagg?hl=zh-CN) to upload pictures. After downloading Image Uploader, uploading a picture and copy the url of picture by using it, you can achieve the feature of uploading pictures. 

### Searching in site

I tried to baidu's search site and para, but I failed. And I saw [swiftype](https://swiftype.com/)  by accident, you can try it in my blog. Here is a [tutorial](http://www.jerryfu.net/post/search-engine-for-hexo-with-swiftype-v2.html) . I recommend swiftype instead baidu and google's search site. 

### Conclusion

Above is the process of building a whole personal blog. Before building the blog, maybe you feel that you need to be in a high level. But after you know it, you may find you can build your blog in short time even you are amateur. I believe that if reader have the determine to build your personal blog, you can be able to do as well as you want. Good luck to you!
